# Introduction:

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on textual data, specifically focusing on tweets. Sentiment analysis, also known as opinion mining, is the process of determining the emotional tone behind a series of words. It is used to gain an understanding of the attitudes, opinions, and emotions expressed within an online mention. The project encompasses various stages, including data collection, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

# Project Structure:

The project is organized into the following directories and files to facilitate modularity and clarity:

data/: Contains the dataset used for training and evaluation.
tweet.csv: The primary dataset containing tweets and their corresponding sentiment labels.
database/: SQL scripts for creating and managing the necessary database tables.
create_tables.sql: SQL script to set up the database schema required for the project.
src/: Source code for various stages of the sentiment analysis process.
data_collection.py: Script for collecting and aggregating data from different sources.
export_for_tableau.py: Script to export processed data for visualization in Tableau.
model_training.py: Script for training the sentiment analysis model.
preprocessing.py: Script for preprocessing the raw text data.
sentiment_classification.py: Script to classify new text data using the trained model.
config.json: Configuration file containing parameters and settings used throughout the project.
database.zip: Compressed file containing the database setup files.
readme.md: This README file providing an overview and instructions for the project.
requirement.txt: List of Python dependencies required to run the project.

# Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

# 1.Clone the repository:

Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
# 2.Navigate to the repository directory:

Change to the directory where the repository is cloned.
# 3.Install the required dependencies:

Use the package manager pip to install the required dependencies listed in requirement.txt.

# Usage
Follow these steps to use the project:

# 1.Data Collection:

Run the data_collection.py script to collect the necessary data. This script gathers tweets and their metadata from various sources.
# 2.Preprocessing:

Preprocess the collected data using the preprocessing.py script. This involves cleaning the text, removing stopwords, tokenization, and other NLP preprocessing steps to prepare the data for model training.

# 3.Model Training:

Train the sentiment analysis model using the model_training.py script. This script applies machine learning algorithms to the preprocessed data to create a model that can classify text into different sentiment categories.

# 4.Sentiment Classification:

Classify new data using the trained model with the sentiment_classification.py script. This script takes new text input and predicts its sentiment based on the trained model.

# Data

The dataset used for this project is a collection of tweets stored in data/tweet.csv. The dataset includes fields such as tweet text, sentiment labels (positive, negative, neutral), and other relevant metadata. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the sentiment analysis model.

# Model Training

The model_training.py script is responsible for training the sentiment analysis model. It leverages machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to build a model capable of classifying text based on sentiment. The training process includes:

# Feature Extraction: 

Transforming text data into numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms.

# Algorithm Selection: 

Choosing appropriate algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM, Deep Learning) for training the model.

Training: 

Feeding the preprocessed data into the selected algorithm to train the model.
# Hyperparameter Tuning:

Adjusting parameters to optimize the model's performance.

# Evaluation
After training the model, it is essential to evaluate its performance to ensure it accurately predicts sentiment. The evaluation process involves:

Splitting the Data: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
Metrics: Using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.
Confusion Matrix: Analyzing the confusion matrix to understand the model's predictions and errors.


# Results
The results of the sentiment analysis model include performance metrics and visualizations.

These results help in understanding how well the model performs and where it can be improved. Key outcomes include:

 # Accuracy:
 The overall accuracy of the model in predicting the correct sentiment.

# Precision and Recall:
Metrics to measure the quality of positive and negative predictions.

# F1-Score:

A balanced measure of precision and recall.

# Visualizations: 

Graphical representations of model performance, such as ROC curves, precision-recall curves, and confusion matrices.
